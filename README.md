# NotesApp
An android notes app that follows the clean architecture rules by Robert Martin (Uncle Bob)Â  & MVVM architecture introduced in Android. I have also tried sticking as i can to the best practices advised by Google. This project is inspired by the Philipp Lackner 'Clean Note' educational project.
Libraries used so far: Room, Jetpack Compose & Hilt for dependency Injection.
Project in progress...
