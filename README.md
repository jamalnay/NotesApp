# Material 3 Notes App
An android notes app that follows the clean architecture rules by Robert Martin (Uncle Bob)Â  & MVVM architecture introduced in Android. I have also tried to stick as much as i can to the best practices and recommandations advised by Google. 
This project is inspired by the Philipp Lackner 'Clean Note' educational project.
Libraries used so far in htis project: 
Material 3, Room, Jetpack Compose & Hilt for dependency Injection.
Project still in progress...
